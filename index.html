# PubMed-Knowledge-Graph
We will publish the latest download link for the dataset here, as well as some necessary instructions.



# Download
The latest PKG version is available on Sun Yat-sen University's [cloud disk](https://pan.sysu.edu.cn/#/link/42DFF7D2D574F592137732B43C2213E8&lang=en).

PKG takes up a lot of disk space, so clicking on the folder icon and downloading the subset you need is recommended.

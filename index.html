<h2>PubMed knowledge graph (PKG)</h2>
        
<br>

<p>A comprehensive knowledge graph dataset encompassing over 36 million papers, 1.3 million patents, and 0.48 million clinical trials in the biomedical field.</p>
  
<br>

<p>The first version of PKG has been published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0543-2">Scientific Data</a>, which extracted bio-entities from 29 million PubMed abstracts, disambiguated author names, integrated funding data through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ExPORTER, collected affiliation history and educational background of authors from ORCIDÂ®, and identified fine-grained affiliation data from MapAffil. You can refer to the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0543-2">"Building a PubMed knowledge graph"</a> for more details of the first version of PKG.</p>

<p>Papers, patents, and clinical trials are indispensable types of scientific literature in biomedicine, crucial for knowledge sharing and dissemination. However, these documents are often stored in disparate databases with varying management standards and data formats, making it challenging to form systematic, fine-grained connections among them. To address this issue, we introduce PKG 2.0, a comprehensive knowledge graph dataset encompassing over 36 million papers, 1.3 million patents, and 0.48 million clinical trials in the biomedical field. PKG 2.0 integrates these previously dispersed resources through various links, including biomedical entities, author networks, citation relationships, and research projects. You can refer to our paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.07969">"PubMed knowledge graph 2.0: Connecting papers, patents, and clinical trials in biomedical science"</a> for more details of PKG 2.0.</p>
     
<br>

<p>We have organized the knowledge graph dataset into a series of relational database tables, named with prefixes A, B, and C.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tables starting with 'A'</strong>: These tables contain the original data tables of PubMed.</li>
    <li><strong>Tables starting with 'B'</strong>: These tables include raw data from other sources used during our data processing. Some of the data also form part of the PKG.</li>
    <li><strong>Tables starting with 'C'</strong>: These tables represent the core data of PKG, centered around Papers, Patents, and Clinical Trials.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>All the data of the knowledge graph have been stored in SQL files, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://pan.sysu.edu.cn/link/EF1C89E4F3B85F4FDE6FFB1C630E2D23">cloud disk</a> of Sun Yat-sen University. Additionally, tables starting with 'C' have also been organized in TSV format and can be downloaded from <a href="https://figshare.com/s/05158da6355d6199d3b7">figshare</a>. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/PubMedKG/PubMedKG.github.io/blob/main/1-PKG2023S4%20(1781-Dec.%202023)%20Features.pdf">Database Features</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/PubMedKG/PubMedKG.github.io/blob/main/PKG%202.0%20Dataset%20Description.pdf">Database Description</a> for more details about how to use the PKG dataset.</p>
